Welcome to my practice git repository where you can change up as much as
you'd like plus work with a real, living, breathing person on the other side.
Here we learn all things git. Feel free to send me Pull Requests just
to discover what it's like when a Repo Master asks you.

<blockquote>
"Can you squash your commits for us"
</blockquote>

and you're all like...

<blockquote>
"How the hell do I do that?"
</blockquote>

This is where we make those mistakes ... so don't be scared :)

##Instructions (Contributing)

Fork this repo and send me a Pull Request with anything from Grandma Peggy's
Crumbled Oatmeal Cookie Recipe to your favorite Sublime Text 2 preferences.
It's all good yo! Learning is the prize in this game.

## Typical and highly useful git commands

``git clone git@github.com:<user_name>/the-repo-you-are-cloning.git``
* Clones your remote origin repo locally

``git fetch upstream``
* Pulls in the remote changes not present in your local repo. Downloads objects and references from another repository.

``git merge upstream/master``
* Merges any changes fetched into your working files

``git add <file>``
* Start tracking new files and also stage changes to already tracked files

``git status`` and ``git diff``
* Tells us what files and assets have been modified and staged

``git status -s``
* This will display what files have been removed, changed or modified.
* (M)  - modified
* (A)  - added
* (AM) - file has not been altered since it was last added

``git commit -m 'the message goes here for the commit'``
* Records a snapshot of the project into your history at the time of your commit.

``git add '*.<file_extension>'``
* This command adds all file types with the same extension, especially from different directories. Without quotes the command will only execute within the same directory it's been called from.

``git rm --cached <file>``
* Unstages a file from the working tree (i.e. stops tracking the file).

``git log``
* Remembers all the changes we've committed so far, in the order we committed them.

``git log --summary``
* See where new files were added for the first time or where files were deleted.

``git remote add origin git@github.com:<user_name>/<repo_name>.git``
* Creates a brand new remote repository.

``git remote -v``
* Show a list of the current remote repositories

``git reset <file>``
* Removes the desired file from staging area.

``git branch -r``
* List all the remote branches currently tracked

``git remote prune origin``
* Deletes branch locally if it has been removed remotely. Helps to remove stale references.

``git checkout <target>``
* Changes the desired target back to the state of the last commit. A target can be a file or a directory (for example).

``git rebase``
* Rebase allows you to [easily change a series of commits, reordering, editing, or squashing commits together into a single commit](https://help.github.com/articles/interactive-rebase).
* Be warned: it's considered bad practice to rebase commits which you have already pushed to a remote repo. Doing so may invoke the wrath of the git gods. [https://help.github.com/articles/interactive-rebase](https://help.github.com/articles/interactive-rebase)

##Adding
``git add <list of files>``
(i.e. git add read me.md license.txt. Can be multiples)

``git add --all``
Add all the new files since last

``git add *.txt``
Add all txt files in directory

##Staging
``git diff``
Show unstated differences since last commit

``git diff --staged``
Gets the staged differences and doisplays what has changed since our last commit

##Reverting
``git reset HEAD <file>``
Head is the last commit on the current branch we are on. What if you stage something you didn't need to be staged? This is the key

``git checkout -- <file>``
Blow away all changes to a file since last commit

``git reset --soft HEAD^``
What if you regret commit? This will undo your last commit. (^ means move commit before HEAD and puts changes into staging).

``git reset --hard HEAD``
Undo Last commit and all changes

``git commit --amend -m "added another file to the commit'``
New commit message will override previous commit message

##Remotes
"Remotes are kinda like bookmarks"

``git remote -v``
Show the current remote repos

``git remote add <name> <address>``
Add a new remote repo

``git remote rm <name>``
Remove remote repo

##Cloning, Branching, Fetching &amp; Merging
``git fetch``
Pulls down any changes but doesn't merge them

``git branch <branch name>``
Makes a new branch

``git checkout <branch name>``
Switching branch and on a different timeline

``git merge <branch>``
Merges branch into master

``git branch -d <branch name>``
Deletes branch

``git checkout -b <branch name>``
Creates a new branch and then switches to it

VI Editor Quick Key Exit
``:wq + enter``

##Pushing &amp; Pulling
``git push -u origin master (remote repo name, local branch name) -u``
Lets you just run git push later on without specifying name and branch

``git pull``
Pull changes in and syncs up your repo

``git pull``
Fetches or syncs local with remote repo. Doesn't update local code

##Branching
``git branch -r``
List all remote branches

``git remote show origin``
Show all the remote branches

``git push origin :<branch name>``
Deletes the remote branch

``git branch -D <branch name>``
Delete the local repo branch and if you don't want the commits any longer on it then delete them too.

``git remote prune origin``
Deletes the branch locally if it has been removed remotely. Helps to remove stale references.

##Rebasing
"Merge commits are bad"

``git rebase``
Move all changes to master local which are not in origin/master remote to a temporary area

##History
``git log``
Viewing the commits history

``git config --global color.ui true``
Color codes the commit SHA

``git log --pretty=oneline`` or ``git log --graph --oneline --all``
Commit and history is one line

``git log --pretty=format:"%h``
Exactly how you want the output using placeholders ( use git help log )

``Date Ranges``
Git log --until

##Removal
``git rm <filename>``
Removes file completely

``git rm --cached <file names>``
Won't be deleted from your file system just keeps the local changes still

##Help
``git help``
``git help <command>``


##Suggestions
 * Add .ruby-version
 * Add .ruby-gemset
 * Remove public/index.html file
 * Add "1 == 1" test.
 * Add "1 == 1" rspec spec.
 * Set up and deploy to Heroku.

**Enjoy**
